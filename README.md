Tagāti Book G
=============

A font for my fictional writing system [Tahano Hikamu](http://benung.nfshost.com/alphabet). Please see the [readme.html](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8026017/tagatibookg/readme.html) file for a description of how to use the font.

Installing
----------

On Windows, you need to copy the files `Tagati Book Regular G.ttf` and `Tagati Book Italic G.ttf` to `C:\Windows\Fonts`. In Linux, fonts installed on a per-user level exist in `~/.fonts`. If you want to download just the font, not the whole source, you can [get a ZIP dump from my Dropbox](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8026017/tagatibookg/tagatibookg.zip).

Important Note
--------------

*Tagāti Book G* uses [SIL Graphite](http://graphite.sil.org) to manage all the nifty diacritic attachment and character reordering, not OpenType. This means that the range of applications you can use the font in will be rather limited, unfortunately. You can't avoid tradeoffs.
